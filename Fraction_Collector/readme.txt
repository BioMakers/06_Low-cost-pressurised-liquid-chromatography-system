1)NEMA_17_DRV8825.fzz
*shows how to wire up the NEMA17 motors to the driver board and the Arduino.
*only shows one out of the two circuits required for this project - the second circuit is identical, except that the Arduino pins need to be changed - see the Arduino sketch for which pins to use

2) SCARA_2D_Positioning_1.2
Arduino sketch for movement of a 2D SCARA arm, using either serial input,
button input or hard-coded values. Work in progress as currently no calibration implemented.

To be added:
*full circuit diagrams of the whole setup
*endstop switches to allow calibration
*functions to move along a defined path to allow collection of sample into 96-well plates or Eppendorf racks
*full document describing how to build the fraction collector
*CAD files for the 3D printed parts
*pictures of the final setup
