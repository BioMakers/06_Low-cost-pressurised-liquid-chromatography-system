Notes: 
2GT / GT2 profiles for the arms are designed according to the official specification, 
with the sprocket on either arm sporting 90 teeth, matched to a 20 teeth sprocket on the stepper motor. 

Print parts and remove support structures as required.
Add 625z ball bearings into both arms and the roller unit, perhaps fix with a dab of glue (depending on the print quality).
Cut 2GT /GT2 belt to size, assemble around the arm and fix with the belt clamps. 
Adjust tension carefully â€“ preferably when the arm is mounted to the base.
Adjust the relative positions of the belt clamps if they block each other during operations.
Glue microswitches into the housing (recommend rear-most slot on the side, lever facing up & lever facing down at the front).
